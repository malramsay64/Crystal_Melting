Normalized Melting
==================

Currently I have been calculating melting rates as a 
fraction of the simulation cell that has converted to a liquid,
however this is typically not the way melting has been calculated.
Current definitions of crystal melting assume the melting occurs 
along an axis imposed by the container,
creating a single face over which the crystal can melt.
The melting is assumed to occur at the same rate across the entire face,
so the melting rate is measured as the progression of the front.
This is a relatively fine for simple crystals with lots of symmetry,
however with the crystals I am investigating,
there are both wildly different faces, 
and a significant orientational component of the molecules.

When studying my molecules,
it makes far more sense to assume that the below image is a blob

than it is to consider the below interface straight
