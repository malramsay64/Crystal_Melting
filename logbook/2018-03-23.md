Calculating Melting Rates
=========================

I would really like to see these new melting rates,
however the calculations of the classification,
the clustering and the convex hull are taking quite some time.
Rather than wait around forever
I am hoping that only calculating the quantities for every 100th configuration
will make this finish in a reasonable amount of time.

The previous calculation had taken 2d 8h so far,
which if I assume was almost done
will still take an hour for the reduced set per input file.
This is far more manageable,
and on the timescale of perfectly reasonable,
however my worry lies in the idea that the calculation could have not been nearly finished...

This is something I should keep an eye on.
