Samba performance tuning
========================

The samba performance of the RDS is slow,
or at least significantly slower that I would expect it to be.
This is based on my opinion that the RDS 
should be a data store which allows for quick access to the data.

Currently on bohr, the USYD VM I have the following performance numbers
- Upload: 260 MB/s
- Download: 60 MB/s

Since I see Argus as an interface to large datasets,
rather than using bohr for the benchmarking
it makes far more sense using Argus
which I can then present as a real use case.

For this use case I will want to benchmark on Argus
using the Argus RDS/RCOS whatever that is called,
compared to the RDS Classic,
in addition to the local disks.
This will give a good idea of what the platform is useful for.

As a use case I will have a collection of files 
that should be used together,
like an entire project worth of files.
Using the time to copy the entire project
as a metric of usability.
At the very least the time to copy from RDS 
to an alternative location as a measure of usability.
