Project Update and Status
=========================

With all the changes to the underlying code bases
and the current experiments,
this is a look at where this project is at
and the changes that have been, and need to be made.

Simulations
-----------

### Interface

The simulations of the interface have been run
and I am relatively confident they will have worked.
All the files that are required are present
I will just have to get around to running
the analysis on the files.

### Dynamics

These simulations have been run,
however the same bugs that affected the other Dynamics simulations
also affected these simulations.
This means there are no trajectory files
from which to calculate the dynamics quantities.
I am currently working to fix these issues
which should just require running the production step of the simulation.
These additional simulations are currently queued to run.

### Defects

The generation of defects was what started this whole rebuilding
being the place where I noticed the issues with thermalisation.
Now I have the thermalisation working properly
this should be a relatively straightforward process.

Analysis
--------

Since this project has kept to this structure since the start,
the subsequent processing of the data should not be an issue.
