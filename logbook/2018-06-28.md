Liquid State Dynamics
=====================

From an analysis of the high pressure dynamics, the slowdown in the melting rate as a function of temperature occurs at a rate faster than that of the liquid dynamics. This result has large errors due to the small amount of data collected although it definitely does warrant further investigation. The figures and for these results are in the file <../notebooks/Melting_Dynamics.ipynb>.

While I do have the analysis of these results completed, there are issues with the analysis. I am using the melting rates of the high temperature crystal which are just the slab. I don't think these rates are truly representative of the normal crystal melting rate. For the low temperatures I don't have the dynamics calculations. So I don't have the data to truly calculate any of the values I am trying to calculate.

These additional calculations that are required will take some time, in part because they are all operating on large datasets and I need to be able to manually start the next step.
