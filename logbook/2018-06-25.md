Crystal Interface Dynamics
==========================

Understanding the effect the crystal interface has on the liquid state dynamics would go a long way
to developing a theory of why the crystal growth of these molecules is so slow. To this end, I will
need to develop an analysis to calculate the spatial dynamics.

With the current set of dynamics analysis I keep the molecular index for all values. This is
currently used for control over how averaging is performed, although in this case I am able to use
it for spatial analysis by separately reading the indexes and positions from the raw configurations.
The other complication is that for the interface simulations I currently have data for, I only have
the data collected at linear time intervals. This is not something currently supported by my
analysis code, so I am going to have to implement that along with a command line flag as an option.

I have implemented the functionality required to calculate these values in sdanalysis 0.5.4.
