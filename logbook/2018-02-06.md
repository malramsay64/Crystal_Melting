Configuring Melting
===================

There have been a few issues with the low pressure melting experiments. Some of these problems have been simple fixes, while others have taken longer to solve. 

I think the main error has been my inability to read the status of a job correctly, interpreting the `X` as eroded instead of finished. Some of the simulations are running faster than the others, I am not entirely sure why, but this made me think there was an issue with the simulations.

Additionally I have had problems with existing files, thinking that the simulations I was observing were the result of the current run, when they were in fact remnants of the previous set of simulations. To prevent this issues from continuing to occur I should look into having a command to automatically delete all the created files.

Finally an error that has plagued me for a while, is the setting of the crystal lattice parameters
individually so that I can have the same number of molecules in all the simulations. This has
previously not been possible, however now I can set variables wherever I like this is not so much of
a problem. What does make things complicated is not thinking about which way the unit cell is facing
and so just randomly changing values. It helps when you know which of the values should be changed.
