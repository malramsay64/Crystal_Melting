Low Pressure Melting
====================

The next step to understanding the behaviour of these crystals 
is to understand if there is any difference between
the high and low pressure simulations of melting.
It is expected that the lower pressure will allow 
the molecules more freedom of movement,
and in turn more mobility below the melting point.
Since the dynamics will be with reference to a melting point anyway,
this is the most appropriate approach
to understanding the rotational motions.

To get this data there is need for a sequence of simulations
- Create the crystal lattice
- Melt the interface
- equilibrate the interface at the desired temperature
- melt the interface at the desired temperature

Simulation
----------

The development of the simulation has taken a little while,
working out the set of commands to run,
in addition to the set of variables to use.
Now I have a set of commands for the melting of the interface,
I will be able to just copy it and change the variables.

Variables
---------

These were chosen to be lower than the melting point 
of the high pressure system.
I have a list of temperatures that are fairly closely spaced 
so that I can get a good idea of the melting point.
