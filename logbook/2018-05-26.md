Harmonic Pinning
================

I need to use a harmonic pinning potential to run simulations
as explained by Aragones et. al. [@Aragones2013].
Here they used NVT simulations of the crystal 
over a range of values of the spring constant,
for 5 million timesteps saving every 100th configuration.
These simulations were run for 16 values of the spring constant,
which were then integrated using gaussian quadrature.
These simulations were carried out at a single temperature and pressure.

Experimental Design
-------------------

The end result of the experiment will be the calculation of the total potential energy.
I will run the simulations with equilibration conditions of
- P = 1.00, T = 0.35
- P = 13.50, T = 1.35
Once the simulations are equilibrated,
I will set up an NVT production run
from which I will collect the data.

I don't know how large the spring constant should be,
so I will use more points than necessary
allowing some of them to be discarded.

The experiment will be the following:
1. Initialise crystal lattice.
2. Equilibrate crystal lattice at desired Pressure and Temperature.
3. Perform inherent structure minimisation of structure to get crystal lattice positions.
4. Equilibrate structure with NVT and harmonic potential
5. Collect production data
