Crystal Surface Area
====================

The computation of the crystal surface area
is a task that can be broken up into a parts.

1. The classification of the liquid and crystal configurations
2. Finding the molecules which are non-crystalline
    - This is because of the solid state phase transitions which we observe
3. Clustering the crystal region
    - find the cluster which contains most of the crystal molecules
    - remove the noise within the liquid
4. Find the area and perimeter of the crystal region

All of these are relatively simple tasks,
(1.) is achievable using the machine learning algorithm I have already developed.
(2.) Is just a simple boolean operation
(3.) Is a little more complicated, however all is that should be required is a clustering algorithm, while
(4.) is finding the convex hull of the cluster from (3.)

For a clustering algorithm we need to clustering of 
both the crystal space and the physical space.
To achieve this it is possible to add the crystalline state 
as an additional dimension to those of physical space.
To have more control over this dimension I can scale it
to increase or decrease the impact of the liquid/crystal boundary.
