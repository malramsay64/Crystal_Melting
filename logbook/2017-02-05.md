Low Pressure Melting
====================

The previous set of simulations [2017-02-02](2017-02-02) had a problem with the equilibration,
having particles leave the simulation cell, likely because of too much energy.
I have set up another set of simulation where the temperature of the melting is reduced to 1.50
and the time the interface is melted is much shorter.
I hope these changes will not have the same problems as the previous set of simulations.
Once I get this dialed in then there should be no further problems.

Preventing this issue
---------------------

Now I have identified a problem,
how could I go about instituting a fix for it.
The problem is that I will have a simulation that exceeds reasonable parameters.
I don't know of any solutions to this problem at the moment,
however since I can query any property of the simulation from python
it is entirely possible to have an automated solution to this problem.
This is really important in these interface simulations
where I have a number of different temperatures that are used.
