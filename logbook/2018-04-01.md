Melting Rate
============

The melting rate I am currently calculating is the change in fraction as a function of time
\[
M_r = \frac{\Delta \%}{\Delta t}
\]
The issue with this formulation is that the rate of melting is going to be dependent 
on the size of the interface, in this case the perimeter.
So the melting rate we want to plot is 
\[
M_r = \frac{\Delta A / \Delta P}{\Delta t}
\]
Where $A$ is the area, $P$ is the perimeter and $t$ is the time.
