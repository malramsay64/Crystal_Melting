"""A module to measure the structural fluctuations of each state.

The concept of this module is to understand how much particles within each state are
moving, to get an idea of the likelihood of transitioning from one state to anther.
States which are highly constrained will allow small amounts of motion, while states
which are more flexible will be able to rapidly change configuration.
