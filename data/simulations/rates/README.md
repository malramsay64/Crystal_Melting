# Rates

This is an experiment for the calculation melting rates for the p2 crystal.
From the interface simulation,
the p2 crystal is the most stable
so it is the crystal structure which has been chosen
to be used for the measurement of melting rates.

This experiment is very similar to the interface experiment
however is more focused
allowing for a wider range of temperatures and replications
while still retaining a reasonable number of simulations.

This experiment is being conducted at pressures of

- 1.00
- 13.50

and the temperature and pressure ranges
need to be replicated in the dynamics experiment
so that a dynamics normalised melting rate can be found.
