# Thermodynamics

This is an experiment to collect
the thermodynamics properties of the crystal at the melting point.
These values are used for developing the model of crystal melting.
The only crystal for which the thermodynamics are required is p2,
since this is the most stable crystal and the one for which
we are developing a model of crystal melting.

The melting points for this crystal are:

Pressure |
---------|------
1.00     | 0.36
13.50    | 1.35
