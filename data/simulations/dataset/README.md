# Dataset

This experiment is designed to be relatively quick,
creating the configurations which will be used for training
the machine learning model for crystal detection.
These experiments are primarily interested 
in the static configurations,
so equilibration is not strictly required.
Additionally configurations are captured
over the range of temperatures and pressures
of interest to have an algorithm which is
accurate over the range of structures
which will be observed in the melting simulations.

This experiment requires simulations of the

- p2
- p2gg, and
- pg

crystal structures.
At pressures of both

- 1.00, and
- 13.50.
