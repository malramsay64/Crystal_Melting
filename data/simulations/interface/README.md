# Interface Experiment

This is an experiment for studying the liquid--crystal interface
for a range of crystal structures at a variety of temperatures.
This is mostly an experiment for understanding
the different crystal structures
and observing how each interface reacts differently.

A secondary goal of this experiment is to confirm
that the p2 crystal is the most stable
and that one of the other crystal structures
isn't more favoured for reasons like kinetics
or entropic factors.

The crystal structures studied in this experiment are

- p2
- p2gg
- pg
